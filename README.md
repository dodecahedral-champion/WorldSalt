# WorldSalt
A general purpose extensible engine for block games.

## Planned Features
* client-server architecture
* ubiquitous extension framework in Lua
* simple engine core provides only things that can't easily be pushed out to extensions
* client protocol base on sense/interaction model to be friendly to AI clients

## Hacking
The engine core can be built with `libraries/WorldSalt.sln`.
The current reference client/server are just stubs, but you can build them with `stubs/stubs.sln`.

All solutions should build in Monodevelop and Visual Studio.
