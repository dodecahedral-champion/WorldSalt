# WorldSalt
A general purpose extensible engine for block games.

* `master` [![master](https://travis-ci.org/dodecahedral-champion/WorldSalt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dodecahedral-champion/WorldSalt)
* `unstable` [![unstable](https://travis-ci.org/dodecahedral-champion/WorldSalt.svg?branch=unstable)](https://travis-ci.org/dodecahedral-champion/WorldSalt)

## Planned Features
* client-server architecture
* ubiquitous extension framework in Lua
* simple engine core provides only things that can't easily be pushed out to extensions
* client protocol base on sense/interaction model to be friendly to AI clients

## Building
The engine core can be built with `libraries/WorldSalt.sln`.
The current reference client/server are just stubs, but you can build them with `stubs/stubs.sln`.

All solutions should build in Monodevelop and Visual Studio.

## Dependencies
### Tests
* NUnit
* [Rhino Mocks](http://hibernatingrhinos.com/oss/rhino-mocks)
