World contains a collection of Entities.
Each Entity has one block grid with at least one block.
Some Entities have a parent Entity.
Entity-Parent connections are between specific blocks on each, but with a point position at a cm position relative to those blocks.
An Entity-Parent connection might change its block and/or point position over time.
Each Entity has a position (cm on three axes), orientation (2pi/256 unit on three axes), and velocity (cm/s on three axes).
Each of the above data is relative to a spatial grid; every Entity is attached to a spatial grid.
Different entities may use different spatial grids, and an entity may use different spatial grids over its lifetime.
Spatial grids can be repositioned, reoriented, or removed.

Every Entity has a total mass (recalculated whenever its block constitution changes).
Every Entity has a centre of mass (recalculated as above).
Every Entity has a total bounding cuboid (recalculated as above).
Every Entity has a total force vector (g cm / s / s, on three axes).  This includes any gravitation.

A block grid has one or more sub-grids; these are for memory management only, and all blocks behave physically as if part of the same grid.
Some of an entity's block sub-grids might be loaded at different times.

Every block type has a density (g per block).
