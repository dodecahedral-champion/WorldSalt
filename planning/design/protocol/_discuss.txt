The protocol currently assumes unlimited bandwidth and no dropped packets, for initial simplicity.  It also assumes packets are received in the order sent.

Later we can telescope some updates into delta packets to reduce bandwidth concerns.

The protocol initially assumes a coordinate system oriented at the client.
This coordinate system lies in place as the client moves around, until a CoordinateUpdate packet arrives in some future sync.  This packet defines the new coordinate origin in the old system.  A CoordinateUpdate packet is always the first packet in a sync response.  The updated system applies to the rest of that response.

A single entity might require multiple GridStatus messages to cover its entire grid.
Only blocks which can possibly be sensed should be sent (e.g., "interior" blocks can be skipped).

Likewise, EntityStatus messages should be sent on an as-sensed basis.

Chunks might benefit from RLE-compressing blanks.
