Chat takes place over a parallel IRC server, instead of through the normal block-interaction protocol.

The server is reified as one or more IRC services which accept commands.

Currently, user identities aren't synchronised between the two sides.
Probably this will consist of modeing IRC users who prove their identity via a cross-protocol challenge.

When user authentication is implemented, users should be able to authenticate via pure IRC if desired.
This allows e.g. admins to access server commands under poor network conditions.
