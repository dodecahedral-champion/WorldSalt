name: Asteroid Belt
criteria:
- The world now consists of a sun surrounded by a belt of asteroids.
- The sun is made of a block type which is a light source (this is an extension).
- The avatar has helmet lights to illuminate what the player is looking at; this is an extension which defines the properties of the avatar's head block.
- An extension defines gravitation: all currently-loaded entities gravitate, according to the Chebyshev metric in the entity's own coordinate system.
- The asteroids are initially in orbit around the sun.
- Persistence loading/unloading behaviour is defined via extensions.
- Objects are unloaded at range depending on their size.
- Block loading is based on sensory availability, so obscured blocks are not transmitted.
