name: Mining Station
landmark: "Steerable vessels"
criteria:
- "The avatar is now a head block, with a child block (upper body) and grandchild block (lower body).  Controls roughly as before."
- "The asteroids now contain crystal ore blocks as well as metal ore.  A refinery can convert crystal ore into processed crystal blocks."
- "The mining pod has new (extension) blocks: flight control panel, thruster, storage, docking clamp"
- "A large mining station is now nearby."
- "The mining station has new (extension) blocks: docking clamp receiver, factory"
- "The avatar can target a factory and interface with it.  Supplying metal/crystal blocks to a factory yields the various artificial blocks."
- "The avatar can target a docking clamp/clamp receiver block and manually release it."
- "The avatar can target a storage block and interface with it.  This allows interacting with the block owning entity's inventory."
- "The inventory of an entity can now be manually organised into a tree of named containers."
- "The avatar can target a flight control panel and interface to it.  The avatar becomes attached as a child of the block owning entity, and client movement controls now control any thrusters on the owning entity."
- "When a docking clamp comes close to a clamp receiver, they are magnetically drawn to each other.  On contact, the clamp owning entity becomes a child of the receiver owning entity."
- "The docking clamp and receiver have specific (/24) orientation, and magnetically align to each other."
- "The avatar can now specify the orientation of a block when placing it."
- "The avatar can now target a block and rotate it in-place."
