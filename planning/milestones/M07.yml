name: Planetary Explorer
landmark: "Planets and natural gravitation."
criteria:
- "The star system now contains three planets: a primordial planet, a verdant planet, and a gas giant.  The verdant planet has a moon, and the gas giant has several.  All are initially orbiting."
- "Entities now consist of multiple sub-grids which can be persistence-controlled separately.  This allows convenient unloading of parts of some large structures."
- "At long viewing range, entities may be rendered at low resolution (a single cube per sub-grid chunk)"
- "The primordial planet contains new (extension) blocks: lava"
- "The verdant planet contains new (extension) blocks: water, dirt, grassy dirt, atmosphere, log, leaves, flowers."
- "The gas giant planet contains new (extension) blocks: atmosphere, heavy atmosphere, crushing atmosphere."
- "Ore can be found on the primordial and verdant planet, and the gas giant moons."
- "The station contains new (extension) blocks: bed, chair, food dispenser."
- "The avatar can interact with a chair block to sit, becoming a child of the block owning entity."
- "The avatar can interact with a bed to sleep, becoming a child of the block owning entity."
- "Entities can now be damaged and destroyed (extension-defined)."
- "The avatar respawns if destroyed.  The respawn point is either the avatar creation point or the last bed slept in."
- "A health meter is displayed on the client GUI."
- "The avatar regains health over time, faster if seated or sleeping."
- "The avatar can interact with a food dispenser, which creates a nutri-block."
- "The avatar can consume a nutri-block nearby or from inventory.  This restores some health."
- "Solid blocks in crushing atmosphere take damage continually."
- "Blocks near solar plasma blocks take damage continuously."
- "Blocks in contact with lava take damage continuously."
- "Lava and water blocks both have flow blocks.  Fluid flow similar to MC's model, but with a more clearly-defined automaton."
- "Leaves and flowers release seeds of the relevant kind.  These attach as a child of any dirt block they rest on.  Attached seeds grow while near water and receiving light."
- "Flower seeds grow directly into flowers after some time."
- "Tree seeds grow into a sapling block, which grows upwards into several sapling blocks.  The sapling blocks then convert into logs and produce leaf blocks."
- "Dirt becomes grassy dirt if adjacent to grass for some time and receiving light."
