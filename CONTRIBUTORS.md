# Who We Are
* People
* Calm and Patient
* Polite and Helpful to others
* Playful and Whimsical
* More Listeners than Talkers
* More Praise-Givers than -Askers
* Prefer Writing over Vidyo-making

This describes how we comport ourselves within the project.
Of course, outside the project we may be as brash and arrogant as we wish. :-)

Any correction should be given Gently and received Modestly.

# How We Work
* Move Slowly and Fix Things
* Seek out the Right Thing
* Fix Past Mistakes
* Improve Past Successes
* Review for Virtues as well as Flaws
* Ask others if you can help with their tasks
* Share Half-Baked ideas: others might finish baking them
* Code to be Readable more than Writeable
* Type-check where we can, and Test what we can't Type
* Be Correct first, then be Efficient

Basically we do things the most boringly-reliable way possible. :-)

# What We Create
* Small Sleek Parts
* Well-Fitting Wholes
* Reliable Behaviour
* Complete Documents
* Strict, Simple, and Stupid

Everything should know what its own job is, and we also should know what its job is!
